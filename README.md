# Stegdb 
  Stegdb is a rudimentary database client implementation for the [STEG](https://github.com/hantyrram/steg) steganographer program.
  The client imitates mongodb database collection API to provide simpler interface to interact with the [STEG](https://github.com/hantyrram/steg) steganographer package.
  
  See [Docs](https://hantyrram.github.io/stegdb) 

*This is a work in progress*
